**Description**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining, summarizing, and visualizing a dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and key characteristics before applying any modeling or advanced analytics. It involves investigating data types, detecting missing or duplicate values, analyzing distributions of variables, identifying outliers, and exploring relationships between features using summary statistics, charts, and plots.

EDA helps uncover trends, anomalies, and underlying relationships, guiding decisions about data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. By combining descriptive statistics with visualizations like histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and correlation heatmaps, EDA provides critical insights that shape the direction of further data analysis and predictive modeling.

**Titanic Dataset**

The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular datasets used for data analysis and machine learning. It contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which sank on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg. The dataset typically includes 891 rows (passengers) and 12–13 features describing each passenger, such as:

* Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes) – Target variable

* Pclass (1st, 2nd, 3rd) – Ticket class

* Name, Sex, Age – Personal details

* SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard) and Parch (parents/children aboard)

* Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked (port of embarkation)

The dataset is commonly used to practice Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering (like handling missing Age or Cabin values), and to build classification models that predict passenger survival. It’s ideal for beginners because it mixes numerical and categorical variables, includes missing data, and offers opportunities to explore patterns such as how gender, age, and class influenced survival rates.
